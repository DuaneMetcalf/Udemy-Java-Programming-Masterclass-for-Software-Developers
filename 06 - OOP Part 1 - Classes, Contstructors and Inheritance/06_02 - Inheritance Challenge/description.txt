Start with a base class of a Vehicle, then create a Car class that inherits from this base class.
Create another class, a specific type of Car that inherits from the Car class.
You sshould be able to handle sterring, changing gears and moving (speed).
Decide where to put the appropriate states and behaviours (fields and methods).

For the specific type of vehicle, you will want to add something specific for that type of car.
