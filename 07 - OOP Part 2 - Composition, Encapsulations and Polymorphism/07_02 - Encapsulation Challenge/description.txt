Create a class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques.
The class will be called Printer and will simulate a computer printer.
It should have fields for the toner level, number of pages printers and whether it's a duplex printer (capable of printing on both sides of the paper).
Add methods to fill up the toner to a maximum of 100%, a method to simulate printing a page, which should increase the number of pages printed.
