Write a method called readIntegers() with a parameter called count that represents how many integers the user needs to enter. The method needs to read from the console until all the numbers are entered, and then return an array containing the numbers entered.

Write a method called findMin() with an array as a parameter that returns the minimum value in the array.
In the main() method read the count from the console and call the readIntegers() method with the count parameter. Then call the findMin() method passing the array returned from the readIntegers() method.

Print the minimum element in the array.
