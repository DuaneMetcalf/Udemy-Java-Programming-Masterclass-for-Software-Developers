Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities;
Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
Create a separate class for Contacts (name and number)
Create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds an arraylist of contacts and should have the functionality listed above.

Add a menu of options available quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact and search/find contact.

When adding or updating a contact, check if the contact already exists by name.

Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the ArrayList to mobile phone, no ints, no get(i) etc and should do everything with the Contact objects only
