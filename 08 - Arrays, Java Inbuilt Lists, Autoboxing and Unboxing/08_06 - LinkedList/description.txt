Create a program that implements a playlist for songs.
Create a Song class that has a title and duration for a song.
The program will have an Album class containing a list of songs.
The albums will be stored in an ArrayList.
Songs from different albums can be added to the playlist and will appear in the list in the order they're added.

Once the songs have been added to the playlist, create a menu of options to:
Quit, skip forward to the next song, skip backwards to the previous song, replay the current song and list the songs in the playlist.

A song must exist in an album before it can be added to the playlist (so you can only play songs that are owned)
As an optional extra, provide an option to remove the current song from the playlist.
