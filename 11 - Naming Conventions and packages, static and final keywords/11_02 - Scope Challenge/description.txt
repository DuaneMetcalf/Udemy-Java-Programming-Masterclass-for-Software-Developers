Write a small program to read an integer from the keyboard (using Scanner) and print out the times table for that number.
The table should run from 1 to 12.

You are allowed to use one variable called scanner for your Scanner instance. You can use as many other variables as you need, but they must all be called x (lower case). That includes any class instances and loop control variables that you decide to use.

If you use a class, the class can be called X (upper case) but any instances of it must be called x (lower case)

Any methods you create must also be called x (lower case)

Optional extra:
Change the program so that ALL variables including the scanner are named x
