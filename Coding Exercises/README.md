Some of the coding exercises may have different numbers next to them compared to the actual course.

The course gets updated, and some exercises got moved around, removed, new ones added by the course creator.
I could have made changes to keep these consistent but I decided to leave all the exercises up as they provide different examples of coding exercises and experience.

Some of the folders are empty at the moment, this is due to some of the exercises being almost identical to some of the challenges, and they follow straigt on, and to be honest, it's a little tiresome doing a challenge, then immediately following it up with a very similar exercise to be done a different way.

I will get around to adding them all once I've got through the majority of the course material, as I think it's good exercise to come back to these and look at other ways to accomplish them.
